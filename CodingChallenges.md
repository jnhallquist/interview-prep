- Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print "Code" instead of the number and for the multiples of five print "Rage". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print "CodeRage".

- You are given a sorted array of integers and a target integer. If this array contains the target integer, return the index at which it is found. Otherwise, return 'Not found'.

- Given two arrays of integers and a target sum, determine whether the first array contains a number which, when added to a number from the second array, equals the target sum. Return all pairs of numbers whose sum equals the target sum.

- Determine if a given string contains all unique characters.

- Given an array of integers, move all zeroes to the end of the array. Preserve the order of the original array. Do not create a temporary array.
